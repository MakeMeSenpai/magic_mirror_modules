# Aquarious - The Interactive Background
This will hopefully become an amazing background iin which others can downlaod 
and use like any other interactive backgroun. But my main goal is to get it so 
that it can optomally preform on a magic mirror that me and group of developers
are working on. These are all my notes and trial. Wish me luck! 
try to use processing.py for OOP https://py.processing.org/tutorials/objects/

**Requirements:**

    Background{Z-index -5}: Made up of a mostly still image in which plants 
    and water can be seen moving. [âˆš]

    Playground{Z-index -4 to -3}: Made up of objects that will be our fish, 
    who will swim around and wrap around the background. Fishes/Objects should
    be allowed to swim over on another, however they are not allowed to swim 
    threw one another. (such as when two fish are in z-index -4 and run into 
    one another, they must find another way to go.) []

    Foreground{Z-index -2 to -1}: Made of a transparent image in which will 
    submirge our objects ini water to give a more realistic approach (Z-index 
    -2). As well, in our Z-index -1, particles should be created behind the 
    users mouse/gesture in order to give a sweeping water effect. This should 
    scare away any fishes/objects in that area. []

    Behind: This is a background after all. So it should always remain behind 
    any added or created features ontop of it. maybe make it so that users cna 
    still make thiings using up to z-iindex -5. But it must remain behind any 
    code the user may want to add. []

    Optomization: Find a way for this into the least memory consuming, and 
    fast application as possible, as to let others easily download this theme 
    from the store when you ship it. Or for other developers who just want to 
    use an amazing background! []

**TODO:**

Skateboard: Objects are created and can be see moving across the screen, 
wrapping around the screen, and there is a proper background (we will be
adding our best graphics later on) basic particles are created and destroyed behind the users 
actions. The application remains in the background. []

Bike: Objects are seen avoiding one another, or swimming over one another, and
proper fish skin to represent who they are. (we will add better fish 
animations later, we simply want a clear representation of fish swimming over 
one another, and avoiding one another). The fish are also seen submurged in 
water. particles are now seen to be a water streak behind the users action. 
(we will make better graphics for this later.) Make sure application remains 
in background, and isn't slow. []

Car: Fishes are seen avoiding users actions, and are expected to temperarily 
disapear off screen if there is too much action. Even if almost the entirity 
of the screen is filled with streaks of water, there should be little to no 
lag, and the background must remain in the background. []

Stretch Limo: Give users the option to toggle on/off particle effects. Ensure 
that the speed of input results the speed of output (such as a fast sweep of 
the screen resulting in a big a swift streak ni the water, while a slow sweep 
results in a soft and slow streak). Optomize the application to your highest 
capability. Ask for help as to how to do so to an even higher extent, do your 
research. Than try try again. Ensure that this stays ini the background. []

Crazy Chopper: Put this in the Magic Mirror, and add other things. Find a way 
to sell this online to others too, so that they may use and enjoy your 
creation. Leave on the internet for other developers to have the ability to 
use a cool background. []
