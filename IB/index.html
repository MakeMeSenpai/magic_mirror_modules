        <!--look at jinja documentation to bring in elements from python to html.
        maybe it is better however to just push html threw python like you usually do.
        if this doesn't work, than we will have to resort to particle effects... and that
        is what we are trying to avoid! Epecially becuase that would mean soo many div tags
        (due to our special effects wanting to be particles) We may have to download Flask.-->
