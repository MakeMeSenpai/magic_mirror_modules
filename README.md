# magic_mirror_modules

A collaborative project in which we hope to build a magic mirror that can accept future modules, and improvements.
These are the foundational models that I have been working on for this project.

### IB 
short for interactive background is also named aquarious, as it is an interactive background being built to react to gesture
sensors and make pretty looking fish inside a pond.
